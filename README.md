# Social Network Analysis

Social network anlaysis has found utility is institutional, classroom and analyses of networked data in socially-based educational games. However, the utility of the method largely rests on being able to ascribe meaning to the **structure of the network**. Without meaningful interpretation of structure there is no added value to a networked model. Understanding measures of centrality and network structure in SNA are therefore a crucial, though difficult, aspect of the method. 

## Goals for this Project 

* Generate sociogram 
* Apply and interpret a centrality measures in a network
* Apply and interpret clustering procedures in a network

## Outline for this Project 

In this project, I build several social network diagrams (graphs/sociograms) of a school classroom and then analyze centrality measures and clusters within the network. In addition, I also analyze multiplex organizational network data from a law firm collected from Lazega (2001) and publically accessed through The Colorado Index of Complex Networks (ICON). In the law firm network, I compare differences in network types, including advice, co-working, and friendship networks. I also examine how network structure is moderated by demographic variables (e.g. age and gender) and functional practice areas (e.g. litigation, corporate).
